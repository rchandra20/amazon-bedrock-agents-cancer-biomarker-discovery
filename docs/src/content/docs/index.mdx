**Built with Amazon Bedrock Agents**

This project leverages Amazon Bedrock's powerful foundation models to create specialized agents for biomedical research tasks. The integration enables:

    1. Access to state-of-the-art language models

    2. Secure and scalable AI infrastructure

    3. Customization for domain-specific tasks

    4. Multi-modal capabilities for diverse research data

## Get started now and use existing agents and orchestrators or customize with your own datasets
